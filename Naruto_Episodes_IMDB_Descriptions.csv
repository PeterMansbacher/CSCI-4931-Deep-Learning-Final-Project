Naruto returns to Konoha after a two-and-a-half-year training journey with Jiraiya and is reunited with Sakura.
"Kakashi gives Naruto and Sakura a test to see how far they had improved. Meanwhile, two Akatsuki members, Deidara and Sasori, arrive at the entrance of the Sunagakure to capture the One-Tailed Shukaku's host, Gaara."
"Sakura and Naruto both demonstrate their newly acquired skills. Meanwhile, Deidara commences his attack on Sunagakure and is confronted by Gaara."
"Gaara is quick to detect Deidara's presence, and an aerial battle ensues with Deidara on his giant bird and Gaara atop sand."
"Naruto and Sakura defeat Kakashi in the survival challenge. Tsunade assigns them to a three-man squad led by Kakashi, who tells them they are now his equals."
"In order to protect his village from Deidara's explosive clay, Gaara uses his chakra to create a giant sand shield."
"Gaara, his strength completely exhausted, is whisked away by Deidara. Kankuro ignores Baki's efforts to stop him and immediately sets out in pursuit with a platoon to rescue Gaara."
"On her way to the Sand Village, Temari encounters Kakashi and his team. Kakashi admonishes Naruto when he tries to rush ahead..."
An urgent message from the Sand Village detailing the Akatsuki's kidnapping of the Kazekage reaches the Hidden Leaf Village. Tsunade wastes no time in ordering Team Kakashi to the Sand Village.
"The Sand ninja fight against time to treat Kankuro. Even the Sand's poison expert, Granny Chiyo, is baffled. The only hope lies with the reinforcements sent by Tsunade."
"Sakura treats a critically ill Kankuro. After extensive training she's now a full-fledged Medic Ninja, and Sakura amazes everyone with her sure, steady hands."
"Pakkun finds the hideout of the Akatsuki. Team Kakashi and Temari prepare to set out to get Gaara back, but Temari is ordered to stay behind and help guard the village."
"Team Kakashi encounter Itachi Uchiha, who had dealt them a bitter defeat in the past. Kakashi warns everyone not to look into Itachi's Sharingan Eyes."
"Guy prepares to use a forbidden secret jutsu. Meanwhile, Naruto falls under Itachi's genjutsu, and all the anti-genjutsu training he underwent with Jiraiya races through Naruto's mind."
"Granny Chiyo and Sakura rescue Naruto from Itachi's genjutsu. Without a moment's delay, Kakashi begins a counterattack."
"After hunting down the Four Tails, Itachi and Kisame are summoned by the leader of the Akatsuki. The leader announces the death of Orochimaru to the gathered members and the possibility of his killer, Sasuke, setting his sights on the Akatsuki organization...."
"Under Kakashi's command, the Leaf ninja set off to find Itachi. Using Kakashi's ninja hounds, they gather as much information as they can on Itachi. Meanwhile, the members of the Hebi also scatter to look for information on Itachi. Led by the ninja hound tracking Sasuke's scent, Sakura arrives in town and draws near to Karin."
"Upon encountering one another, Sasuke and Deidara engage in battle. After exchanging a few blows to test Sasuke's strength, Deidara conjures up his specialty clay dragon and wages long-range attacks against Sasuke from high above. With Tobi's backup support, the battle seems to be going to Deidara."
"Determined to destroy the Sharingan to rid himself of the taste of defeat he received from Itachi, Deidara unleashes his biggest attack, the C4 Karura. Created to kill Itachi, this fierce weapon is capable of destroying living beings from the inside using millions of nano-sized bombs. Can Sasuke escape this attack fueled by Deidara's determination to destroy the Sharingan?"
"Sasuke goes missing after being caught by Deidara's suicidal bombing. Sensing his disappearance, Jugo, Karin, and Suigetsu race to Sasuke's last location, where the three Hebi members discover...?"
"Leaf ninja, she notifies the others and the Hebi members quickly leave the inn. To allow Sasuke to focus on his coming battle with Itachi, Karin comes up with a plan to keep the Leaf ninja occupied."
"During the reign of the Second Hokage, the young Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade are assigned to Hiruzen Sarutobi's platoon as Genins. While training, Jiraiya accidentally transports himself to Mount Myoboku, opening the path to fulfill his destiny."
Jiraiya's journey to seek out a student is postponed due to the outbreak of the Third Great Ninja War. Jiraiya joins Tsunade and Orochimaru to battle the Village Hidden in the Rain.
Jiraiya successfully infiltrates the Hidden Rain Village by hiding inside the toad Gamagoro. He sets out to gather information but finds no indications of a civil war occurring within the village.
"Foreseeing a possible battle, Jiraiya takes precautionary measures by storage releasing the scroll toad that commands the key to Naruto's Eight-Signed Seal."
"Jiraiya battles to defeat his former student Pain, who is now driven by his twisted ideals as an Akatsuki member."
Jiraiya completes his Sage Mode transformation to battle the three Pains.
"Having lost his arm, Jiraiya is outmatched by the six Pains now appearing before him. Of the six, the one called Tendo is revealed to be Jiraiya's former student Yahiko. Jiraiya is still puzzled by the Rinnegan's true powers, but before he can gather his thoughts, he is forced back into battle."
"As Sasuke proceeds to Itachi's hideout, Tobi messes with Naruto."
"While Itachi waits for Sasuke in the Uchiha hideout, he recalls the past incident that led to his defection from the Leaf Village. When Sasuke arrives, the fated battle begins between the two brothers."
"Following their fierce genjutsu battle with the Sharingan, Itachi explains the secret behind the most powerful ocular jutsu, the Mangekyo Sharingan, and the history of the Uchiha clan..."
"Sasuke loses his left eye to Itachi, but it turns out to be a genjutsu created by the Mangekyo Sharingan. Breaking free of the Tsukuyomi by force, Sasuke makes a furious comeback against the injured Itachi."
"At the climax of the battle, both Itachi and Sasuke run out of chakra. However, Sasuke reveals that his actions up until now were only a preparation for his final jutsu."
"Naruto and his comrades find themselves held up by Tobi, whose strange jutsu is more than just a simple genjutsu."
"In the Akatsuki hideout Sasuke comes face to face with Madara. Announcing himself as Itachi's accomplice from that fateful night, Madara goes on to tell Sasuke the truth about Itachi that he could never have known."
"The Uchiha clan was plotting a coup d'etat. The story as told by Madara leaves Sasuke at a loss for words. Because of his gifted talent, Itachi was forced to suffer, torn between his loyalties to the Leaf Village and the Uchiha clan."
"Chiyo and Kakashi realize that the attack was just a diversion, and that the Akatsuki have already begun the process of extracting the Tailed Beast from Gaara. Granny Chiyo explains to Naruto and Sakura the connection between the Tailed Beast and the JinchÃ»riki..."
"Teams Kakashi and Guy take a short rest. Granny Chiyo watches Naruto dozing off and is reminded of Sasori as a child. The pursuit resumes, and when Chiyo wonders why Naruto puts such effort into rescuing Gaara..."
Teams Kakashi and Guy reach the Akatsuki hideout. They hurry to infiltrate but are thwarted by a five-seal barrier. The only way to break the barrier is to remove all five seals at once.
"Breaking the five-seal barrier set off a trap, which now has Team Guy battling amazingly accurate copies of themselves. Back at the Akatsuki hideout, Deidara and Sasori struggle to take the Nine-Tail Jinchuuriki."
"At last, the showdown between the old woman and her grandson begins. Sakura is confused by Sasori's strange appearance, and Granny Chiyo explains that this is Hiruko..."
"Granny Chiyo and Sakura manage to expose Sasori, who amazingly looks no older than he did twenty years earlier. Chiyo is even more shocked at the second puppet that Sasori produces."
Sakura is caught by Sasori's tactic and surrounded by a poison cloud. But she uses a Paper Bomb to blow herself free from the poisonous fumes.
"Chiyo and Sakura take cover, and Sasori wastes no time unleashing a ruthless attack. Chiyo fights back to protect Sakura, but in an instant the Father and Mother puppets are sealed by the Iron Sand."
Sakura counters the Iron Sand attack of the Third Kazekage puppet with superhuman strength. She learned from Tsunade that the most important skill of a Medic Ninja is the ability to evade an attack.
"Sakura reveals that she took an antidote against Sasori's poison which will make her immune to it for three minutes, forcing herself and Chiyo to end the battle quickly. Meanwhile, Naruto and Kakashi continue their pursuit of Deidara. Deidara attempts to split up Naruto and Kakashi by creating a swarm of explosive jumping crickets out of his clay and has them pursue Kakashi. Kakashi makes a shadow clone as a decoy and the crickets, mistaking the shadow clone for the real Kakashi, detonate harmlessly. Kakashi then catches back up with Naruto and reveals a plan. Sakura ..."
"Naruto and Kakashi continue to pursue Deidara while Sakura and Chiyo continue the battle with Sasori. Sakura manages to shatter Sasori's puppet body, but he reforms. Chiyo summons the Ten Puppets of Chikamatsu. Sasori, remarking on Chiyo's ability to control so many puppets, summons one hundred human puppets and the final battle begins. Sakura and Chiyo seem to trap and defeat Sasori but, under cover of the battle, Sasori, who had transferred himself to another puppet, attacks Chiyo from behind. Sakura intercedes, taking the sword thrust meant for Chiyo."
"Chiyo injects the last remaining antidote into Sakura and manages to stab Sasori in his only living part, his heart, using the Father and Mother puppets. With Sasori immobilized, Chiyo revives the nearly dead Sakura using her Resurrection Technique. As he dies, Sasori rewards Sakura for defeating him, telling her where he planned to meet with one of his spies who had been working undercover as one of Orochimaru's subordinates. Meanwhile as Kakashi and Naruto are pursuing Deidara, Kakashi reveals his plan to activate his version of Mangekyo Sharingan."
"Team Guy senses the result of the Sakura and Granny Chiyo's desperate struggle while still in battle with his deadly copy. Although Guy's team members are showing fatigue, their copies remain strong!"
"Sakura hurries to get to Naruto with Granny Chiyo, who is suffering from the poison. The members of Team Guy rush to assist Team Kakashi."
"Naruto loses all reason to anger and is gradually taken over by the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit. Having been forewarned by Jiraiya, Kakashi narrowly manages to suppress the Nine-Tailed Fox."
"Relying on Naruto's power, Granny Chiyo performs the Transmigration Jutsu on Gaara. Sakura is saddened when she realizes the cost of this jutsu."
"Deidara survives his battle and begins to search for his missing arm. Meanwhile, Zetsu and his subordinate, Tobi, who wishes to join Akatsuki, search Sasori's remains for his ring. Deidara later finds the two searching for his own ring. The leaf ninja leave Sunagakure after their victory, and Danzo gives Sai instructions for his new team, Team Kakashi. The leaf and sand ninja pay their respects at Chiyo's grave, and Gaara and Naruto shake hands before departing."
Everyone has returned to the Hidden Leaf Village. Kakashi is hospitalized for a week due to the strain caused by his Mangekyo Sharingan.
"Naruto, Choji and Shikamaru attempt to capture and interrogate Sai, but Sai withdraws after insulting Naruto. Shortly afterward, Ino appears. Concerned that the demon fox could fall into Akatsuki hands, the village elders challenge Tsunade's plan to send Naruto out of the village without the still bedridden Kakashi. Tsunade promises to protect Konoha with her own life if Naruto is captured, but is still forced to compromise with Danzo by adding Sai to Team Kakashi. She also temporarily replaces Kakashi with ANBU member Yamato and warns him to keep an eye on Sai. ..."
"Yamato takes temporary leadership of Team Kakashi while Sai insults both Naruto and Sakura. While preparing to set off, Sai receives an envelope from a Root shinobi containing secret orders from Danzo, and Sakura consults with Tsunade. Jiraiya then meets with Tsunade and Yamato in Kakashi's hospital room to brief Yamato on the demon fox within Naruto, detailing the ""demon fox's cloak"", and revealing a scar he got from Naruto when the fourth tail formed. Finally the new Team Kakashi set off on their new mission, to intercept an Akatsuki spy and gather information about..."
"The new Team Kakashi heads for Tenchikyo. To Naruto, Sai is just temporarily filling in for Sasuke. When Sai shows his contempt for Sasuke, the antagonism comes to a head."
"Sakura comes across Sai working on an abstract painting. He tells her that he's unable to give it a title. Bothered by his manner, Sakura finds an unusual picture book among Sai's things."
"In preparation for Tenchikyo, Yamato conducts a half-day simulation in order to get a grasp on the fighting skills and jutsu of Team Kakashi. Sai abandons Naruto to conclude the simulated mission successfully."
"The day for capturing the spy is finally here. Just as planned, Yamato takes on Sasori's likeness and waits until the Akatsuki spy appears. The spy turns out to be none other than Kabuto."
"Faced with Orochimaru, his sworn enemy, Naruto suddenly releases the power of his Nine-Tailed Fox. When Yamato sees Naruto's fourth tail appear, he recalls Jiraiya's tale of how he nearly lost his life to the transformed Naruto."
"When his third tail appears, all that Naruto can see is Orochimaru. He is blind even to his teammates."
"With the release of his fourth tail, Naruto completely loses his awareness and is overtaken by destructive impulses."
"Although he has changed almost completely into his animal form and has lost all awareness, Naruto refuses to give up the idea of bringing Sasuke home."
"Taking advantage of the confusion, Sai makes contact with Orochimaru. After reviewing the contents of the documents given to him, Orochimaru decides to take Sai back to the hideout."
Naruto and Sakura are shocked when they hear that Danzo's goal is to work with Orochimaru to once again attempt to defeat the Leaf Village.
Naruto is shocked to learn that he was the one responsible for the destruction around them and for Sakura's injuries.
"Sai shudders when he finally meets Sasuke face to face in Orochimaru's hideout. The list that Sai gave to Orochimaru lists the members of the Anbu Black Ops, the corps under the direct control of the Hokage."
"Team Kakashi is able to find Sai with Yamato guiding them. They immediately begin questioning Sai about Danzo's plans for destroying the Leaf Village, and surprisingly, Sai divulges everything."
"Kabuto carries out a surprise attack on Team Kakashi to take back Sai, but a change has come over Sai since Sakura pointed out his contradictions."
"Naruto, while nursing his injuries caused by the release of the Nine-Tailed Fox, searches frantically for Sasuke. Seeing this, Sai recalls the feelings he once had for his older brother and finally manages to complete his unfinished picture."
"Team Kakashi are stunned to learn that Sai's true mission is to kill Sasuke. Naruto wants to believe that the smile Sai showed them was real, but there is a possibility that it was all an act."
"Team Kakashi finally have their wish to be reunited with Sasuke granted. Although it has been three long years, Sasuke's feelings have not changed. His ultimate goal is to get revenge against his older brother, Itachi."
"Sasuke's desire for revenge remains firm, no matter how hard Naruto tries to talk him out of it. Yamato tries to take Sasuke by force, but interference by Orochimaru brings things to a quick close."
"Naruto's been having nightmares about a mysterious person releasing the Nine-Tail's power. After remembering their recent encounter with Sasuke, Naruto realizes that he must get stronger. Meanwhile, Sai tries to adapt to everyday life with Naruto and Sakura. When the group goes to visit Kakashi to discuss the situation, Kakashi lets Naruto know that he has special training for him that will make him stronger, fast. They are joined by Team 10, who have also come to visit."
"Naruto begins to train with Kakashi. Kakashi finds it exhausting working with Naruto, who can't understand anything explained to him."
"Learning that his chakra is of the ""wind"" type that is outstanding for fighting, Naruto puts more effort into his training."
"Team Kakashi is ordered to resolve the frequent vandalizing of graves at the Fire Temple. When it becomes clear that the vandals aren't after the possessions buried with the dead, Yamato suspects that they want the corpses of the ninja buried in the four hidden tombs near Fire Temple."
"At the Fire Temple, Chiriku explains to Team Kakashi that the hidden tombs hold the guards of the Land of Fire's feudal lord. At one time Chiriku and Asuma were members of that organization. Team Kakashi learn about a terrible incident caused by the Twelve Ninja Guardians. Meanwhile, as Naruto watches the young monks training, he notices a strain in the relations between Sora and the other monks."
"Word comes that the last of the hidden graves has been broken into. Naruto and the others go after the coffin, but it turns out to be a trap."
"Know what this is about?
 Be the first one to add a plot."
"Sora confronts Furido, the mysterious figure who has broken into the hidden graves. Impressed by Sora's unusual strength, he admonishes him, ""You should reevaluate how you use that power Heaven has blessed you with,"" and disappears, leaving him with a cryptic message that he is an old friend of his father."
"Flame from the Amaterasu still remains on the battlefield as Naruto and his teammates continue to search for Sasuke. But despite the search team's best efforts, they cannot find any trace of him."
"The Taka split up with the Akatsuki to hunt down the remaining Tailed Beast. At the Land of Lightning they go up against Killer Bee, whose attack utilizing Lightning Style and seven blades proves to be more than a match for them."
"The Leaf ninja fail to capture Itachi and also lose track of Sasuke. Calling off their pursuit, the team is heading back to the village when an urgent assignment from Lady Tsunade comes in. The mission stems from a treaty between the Third Hokage and the En no Gyoja of the Tsuchigumo Clan..."
"Naruto and his teammates are assigned to escort Hotaru, En no Gyoja's granddaughter, to the Tsuchigumo Clan's village located in the mountains. But Hotaru's mind is still attached to Utakata, who left after Naruto's arrival..."
"Having arrived at the village, Hotaru parts with Naruto and his team. But the Magaki Troops are one step ahead and threaten Hotaru to hand over the forbidden jutsu. Utakata appears, and Shiranami recognizes him as a bounty listed in the Hidden Mist's bingo book..."
"Yamato and Sai recognize their opponents as trackers from the Hidden Mist Village, but Naruto attacks without questioning. The Hidden Mist demands Utakata be handed over to them in exchange for Hotaru."
"Hotaru is brought back to the fort in Mount Katsuragi. Naruto, outraged to learn the forbidden jutsu was embedded inside Hotaru, demands an explanation from Tonbei. But it was none other than Hotaru herself who wished for this."
"Believing Shiranami's story, Hotaru writes a parting letter addressed to Utakata and leaves Mount Katsuragi. Meanwhile Naruto, still searching for Shiranami, falls into the Magaki Troops' trap but manages to escape thanks to help from Utakata."
"Naruto and Utakata successfully enter the Tsuchigumo village thanks to help from Sakura, Sai, and Yamato. Utakata senses the chakra filling the atmosphere and terrain behaving oddly, and together with Naruto, they enter the cave where the anomaly is originating."
Naruto has a strange nightmare several days after their failure to bring Sasuke home. Even after he awakens wisps of the dream keep haunting him.
"Returning from the mission, Naruto recollects his strange encounter with Itachi. What did the now deceased Itachi wish to tell him? As Naruto ponders this, Kakashi makes an abrupt visit."
"Naruto wanders the streets of the Leaf Village, grief stricken over the death of Jiraiya. Unable to overcome his feeling of loss, Naruto traces back through his memories of Jiraiya. What can help the heartbroken Naruto get back on his feet?"
"Naruto and his friends successfully decipher the code Jiraiya left behind with the help of some information Naruto has. The crew immediately calls Fukasaku over, but the message is not enough to solve the mystery of Pain."
"At Mount Myoboku, Naruto begins his Sage Jutsu training under Fukasaku. The first challenge is ""Don't move."" Fukasaku explains that an extensive amount of time is necessary in order to take in nature energy."
"Naruto continues his Sage training at Mount Myoboku, but with very slow progress. Fukasaku runs out of patience and suggests they move on to the next training..."
"Shikamaru and the others wait for the information Jiraiya brought back to be analyzed. The Hidden Leaf ninja continue their data analysis, when disaster strikes the village"
"The Leaf Village is under heavy attack from Pain and Konan. Hearing the Akatsuki attack, Tsunade attempts to contact Fukasaku..."
"In one area of the village, Kakashi enters battle against Tendo Pain, but he can't keep up with Tendo's mysterious attacks. Shurado joins the fight, and Kakashi struggles with the two-on-one disadvantage."

"Tsunade comes face to face with Tendo Pain on the rooftop of the Hokage mansion. When Pain demands the Nine Tails be handed over, Tsunade refuses."
"Sensing danger at hand, Naruto, along with Fukasaku, rushes back to the Leaf Village from Mount Myoboku. But what they see is the remains of the Leaf Village, leveled beyond recognition."

Naruto loses himself after seeing Hinata taken out right before his eyes. His anger triggers the Nine Tails' chakra to go out of control.
"Naruto meets Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, inside his inner world."
"By chance, Naruto and Sora get Asuma to coach them. Under the guidance of Asuma's iron fist, they immerse themselves in training with Wind Chakra."
"The story goes back to right before the start of the final rounds of the Chunin Exam. As Naruto trains in preparation for his upcoming match, he hears Jiraiya speak of ""the Fourth Hokage's legacy."""
Naruto and the others take on the oncoming challenges in order to find the secret technique and break the previous record set by the Fourth Hokage. But Naruto's impulsive action leads the group into various troubles.
"Naruto comes face to face with Nagato and Konan. Naruto, wanting to confront the problem of their hate-filled ninja world, asks to hear Nagato's side of the story before coming up with an answer."
"To fulfill their dream, Nagato, Yahiko, and Konan walk through the war zone in search of Jiraiya, hoping to learn ninjutsu from him. After completing their training, the three form an organization with Yahiko as its leader."
"Naruto remains silent after learning of Nagato's painful past. Nagato claims true peace cannot exist in this cursed world, dismissing Jiraiya's ideal as nothing more than wishful thinking."

Yamato believes that the assailants were not grave robbers but were after Sora. He decides to appoint Sora to Team Kakashi as a temporary stand-in for the injured Sai.
"Asuma supervises Naruto and Sora's wind chakra training, and notices that Sora, like Naruto, has very powerful chakra. Tsunade and Yamato learn from Chiriku that Sora was inadvertently responsible for an incident in which the Temple of Fire was destroyed. Later, Asuma gives Sora a claw made from the same materials as his chakra blades. It is revealed that Asuma killed Sora's father Kazuma, who had planned to kill the Hokage. Furido then approaches Sora, telling him that Asuma is responsible for his father's death and passing him two ""king"" pieces from a Shogi set for ..."
"Danzou is brought in for questioning after being caught meeting with a young Rain ninja. Sora confronts Asuma, and Asuma admits to having killed Kazuma.

Sora retreats as Shizune and a few other ninja arrive, but Naruto pursues him. At that moment,..."
"Under cover of a giant power outage, Furido begins his assault on the Hidden Leaf. The village immediately goes on alert, but Furido's men put up a barrier, and everyone in the village is trapped inside. Naruto and Asuma finally catch up to Sora, who is planning an escape in the midst of the panic. He explodes with anger at Naruto's demand to know why he attacked Tsunade. But Asuma is quick to suspect that there is someone behind Sora, someone who knows about the coup d'état incident involving two groups within the Guardian Shinobi Twelve, and realizes that the ..."

Asuma gets trapped by Kitane in a force field of lightning. Meanwhile, Yamato and Sakura kill their opponents, and Shikamaru heads to the battlefield with a plan to defeat the zombies. Just as he puts it into motion, however, Fuen's barrier falls and Fudo's revival technique ends, and the zombies turn to dust."
"Naruto deduces that Fuuka's secret consists of switching bodies to use each corresponding element and that her hair preserves her youth and body. Naruto damages her hair and it takes a life of its own dispensing the body, but Naruto finally kills it with a Rasengan. Meanwhile, Asuma manages to break free of the electric barrier, catch up with Kitane and defeat him in a short fight. Realizing that Kitane is no more, and that his three other companions were killed, Furido causes the 3 other ninja guardians to disappear. But Furido has a back up plan, Sora."
"Naruto and Asuma catch up to Sora, only to find him shrouded in ominous chakra and undergoing a change."
"Furido's true form belongs to Kazuma, one of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve who had planned the coup d'Ã©tat. Asuma puts his honor on the line and goes back ten years to battle Furido once more."
"The struggle between Naruto and Sora continues. Asuma and Kazuma fight. Sai arrives, having sneaked out of hospital, and binds Kazuma with an ink snake. Kazuma breaks out of Sai's jutsu and charges Asuma, but is killed. Naruto eventually reaches Sora, who manages to release the Nine Tails's chakra. Sora then leaves the village to travel the world. Asuma and Shikamaru play shogi and discuss who the king of Konoha is. Elsewhere, two Akatsuki members, Hidan and Kakuzu, appear chasing the Two Tails Jinchuuriki."
"Work continues in Hidden Leaf Village to erase the scars of battle. As he watches Konohamaru and the others helping with the reconstruction, Iruka sees how his students have matured."
"With Kakashi's return, Naruto resumes training for his new jutsu. Kakashi explains that the transformation training will enter the next stage. This time, only Wind Chakra will be used to cut through a waterfall. Hidan and Kakuzu, who have captured Two Tails, leave it with Zetsu and head for the Land of Fire in search of Nine Tails. The first place they reach is the Fire Temple, where the priests go into a near panic, and Chiriku confronts the Akatsuki."
The lone surviving priest is carried into Hidden Leaf Village where he reports the destruction of the Fire Temple.
"In order to capture the Akatsuki, the Hidden Leaf cast a net that even an ant could not crawl through. Still, the Akatsuki elude them and frustrate Tsunade to no end. Around that time, Asuma and the others arrive at the Fire Temple, only to find it completely destroyed. Chiriku's corpse is missing, and Asuma surmises that the Akatsuki were after the bounty on Chiriku's head. They immediately dispatch a messenger to Hidden Leaf to submit a report and head for the nearest center where the Akatsuki can turn in Chiriku's body for payment. Back at Hidden Leaf, Naruto takes..."
"Naruto is learning the elements of Wind Style Jutsu, and Kakashi lectures him on the difficulties of developing a new jutsu. According to Kakashi even the Fourth Hokage was not able to embed elemental chakra into his jutsu. Naruto feels a heavy sense of responsibility and puts his entire being into developing the new jutsu. Meanwhile, the Akatsuki duo turns in Chiriku's body to collect the bounty. What is the fate of the Hidden Leaf team who are pursuing them...?"
"Asuma and his team finally confront Hidan, and a battle ensues. They fight with all their strength but are shocked at Hidan's power."
"Hidan releases a baffling jutsu, and Asuma bears the brunt of the attack. The jutsu is a special trick which links Hidan with Asuma's body."
"Hidan's immortality enables him to stay alive even with his head cut off, although he cannot move his body. Kakuzu sews Hidan's head back on with threads that sprout from his body. Izumo and Kotetsu try to attack Kakuzu, but he manages to grab them both by using his body threads, restraining them and suffocating them as well. Hidan, now able to move again, returns to the circle and stabs himself with the blades of his scythe; he finishes it off by stabbing himself in the chest with another spike, fatally wounding Asuma."
"Asuma is mortally wounded by Hidan's jutsu, and the Akatsuki have the rest of the Hidden Leaf in a bind."
"In a faraway land, the Akatsuki reveal their true aim of world conquest. And back at Hidden Leaf Village, Shikamaru gives his report of the mission to Tsunade."
"Asuma's funeral is held in Hidden Leaf Village amid deep sadness. Shikamaru is the lone absentee, unable to get over the loss."

"The Chunin Exams finally begin and the proctor for Round One is none other than Shikamaru! The first exam is a written test. The entrants are separated from their teams, and with little explanation from Shikamaru, the exam begins. The time limit is 30 minutes and there are only three questions. As the minutes tick away, Neji remembers the last Chunin Exams where Naruto turned in a blank sheet and still passed. He begins to realize that this exam is not about measuring one's problem-solving skills!"
"The genin are unable to figure out the answer and start to panic. Neji announces to everyone in the room that he will tell them how to answer the question. Some of the genin don't agree with Neji's taking the lead and try to pick a fight, but fighting is prohibited. Those who fear elimination follow Neji's instructions, and soon the time limit is up. However, Shikamaru introduces another question to be answered within three minutes. Will Neji and his team be able to pass this round?"
"Kankuro tries in vain to stop Gaara from supervising the exams due to the lack of security and the threats against his life. Gaara vows to see the exams through to completion because of their significance to him as the place he first met Naruto. On the night before the Second Exam, the entrants gather in the cafeteria, and a brawl breaks out. While the Hidden Leaf stand by helpless, the only one who can calm everyone down is Fuu from the Hidden Waterfall Village."
"The Second Exam finally begins! To pass this stage, each team must take possession of both the Heaven and Earth scrolls and make it to the designated site in the center of the Demon Desert within 72 hours.

However, Lee is eager to challenge Shira!"

However, Lord Gaara recognizes Shira's taijutsu abilities and appoints him as his own taijutsu coach. Envious of Shira's sudden rise to prominence, the other Sand shinobi criticize and attack him. Noting the similarities of their circumstances, Lee is outraged at the ones who hurt and belittled Shira and sets out in pursuit!"

"As the team prepares for dinner, Tenten pulls out a scroll that contains all the ingredients for okonomiyaki. Lee is amazed at her ability to conjure up anything and mentions that she is ""convenient"" to have around. Tenten takes offense and storms off.

While Ino tends to Sakura's wound with Medical Ninjutsu, she remembers back to when she ducked out of her Ino-Shika-Cho training and how her intense rivalry with Sakura drove her to ask Lady Tsunade if she could become her apprentice."
"As Ino and her team head toward an oasis, they are attacked by a team of Sand Shinobi comprised of Ameno, Shishio, and Kouji. Ameno is a Medical Ninja whose skills rival Sakura's. She also has a jutsu that proves difficult to counter. Kouji is a ninja who specializes in power-based attacks, like Choji. Shishio has a jutsu that enables him to disappear and stalk Team 10. Just as Ino and her teammates are pushed to the limit, Ino remembers her Yamanaka Clan training, which she once tried hard to avoid, and unleashes her Sensory Perception Jutsu!"

"Gaara meets with Fugi, the mastermind behind the assassination attempt on his life. He confides that perhaps, after all the fear and pain he has wrought upon the Sand, he has no right to be their leader. But there are those who accept him without prejudice--the next generation. Gaara, who has never felt this more deeply than during the Chunin Exams, tells Fugi to take his life, and his life alone, without involving the young shinobi. Meanwhile, Fuu, who has learned that there is someone very much like her by the name of Naruto, sets out to meet him."
